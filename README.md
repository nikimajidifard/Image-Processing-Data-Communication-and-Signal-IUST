### Signal and System project
1. Image Storage
Research on Image Storage Methods:
Investigate image storage methods such as RGB and Grayscale.
Research different image formats (e.g., .png, .jpg) and determine which ones are lossy and which are lossless. Examine at least three formats and identify one lossless format.
2. Edge Detection
Research on Edge Detection Algorithms:
Investigate edge detection algorithms in images, such as Sobel and Canny, and explain their applications.
Read a color image of yourself using MATLAB, perform edge detection using MATLAB functions, and explain the steps involved.

4. Convert and Add Noise to Image:
Convert the image from the previous step to a black-and-white image using MATLAB.
Add noise to the image so that the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is 6 dB.
Research the concept of SNR and explain your findings.
Denoise the image and use a metric to show how well the denoising process worked. Apply this metric to the noisy, denoised, and original images to obtain the values.
