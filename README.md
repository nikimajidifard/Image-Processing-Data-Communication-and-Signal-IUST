### Signal and System project
1. Image Storage
Research on Image Storage Methods:
Investigate image storage methods such as RGB and Grayscale.
Research different image formats (e.g., .png, .jpg) and determine which ones are lossy and which are lossless. Examine at least three formats and identify one lossless format.
2. Edge Detection
Research on Edge Detection Algorithms:
Investigate edge detection algorithms in images, such as Sobel and Canny, and explain their applications.
Read a color image of yourself using MATLAB, perform edge detection using MATLAB functions, and explain the steps involved.

4. Convert and Add Noise to Image:
Convert the image from the previous step to a black-and-white image using MATLAB.
Add noise to the image so that the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is 6 dB.
Research the concept of SNR and explain your findings.
Denoise the image and use a metric to show how well the denoising process worked. Apply this metric to the noisy, denoised, and original images to obtain the values.

### Data Communication project
1. Reading an Image
● Use the imread command to load a color image of yourself into MATLAB.
● Determine the size of your image.
● Research the imtool function in MATLAB and include 2 applications of it along with screenshots of the tasks you performed using it in your report.
● What function can be used to save image information? Use it to save your image information.

3. Image Processing
● How can you enhance the contrast of images in MATLAB? Explain and enhance the contrast of the image loaded in the previous step and save the resulting image in JPEG format using the imwrite function.
● What function can be used to make the image more precise and clearer? Use it to make the details of your image clearer.
● Binarize your image and research its relationship with the threshold.

3.Image Quality
● Use the imresize function to double the dimensions of your image.
● Research the concept of resolution or pixel resolution and based on your findings, increase the pixel resolution of the original image by 4 times and reduce its dimensions by half.
● What is image quantization? Use the relevant commands to set the quantization levels of your image to 70, 20, and 140 and describe the differences.
● Research the sliding histogram method and demonstrate it for your image.
